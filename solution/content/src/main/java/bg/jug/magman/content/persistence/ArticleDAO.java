We had everything: seminar talks with local and foreign speakers, hands on labs, Adopt OpenJDK and Adopt a JSR hackathons, a code retreat and a big international conference. In this blog post I will briefly go through all the events that kept our community busy in 2015.", "Bilbo Baggins");

It has its page and mailing list and its main purpose is to experiment with ideas for implementing the new concept before creating the Java Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), the Java Specification Requests (JSRs) and committing source code in the real repositories. Features like lambdas, script engine support, method handles and invokedynamic walked this way before entering the official Java release.", "Spider Man");

While the discussion whether they should be reified, i.e. the generic parameter information is not erased by javac, is arguably the hottest topic for years now, the lack of support for primitives as parameter types is something that at least causes some confusion. It leads to applying unnecessary boxing when for example you want to put an int into a List (read on to find out about the performance penalty). It also leads to adding “companion” classes in most of the generic APIs, like IntStream and LongStream for example.", "Spider Man");
